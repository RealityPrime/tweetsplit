# tweetsplit

This is a small MacOs application to split longer text chunks into individual threaded tweets with "tweet#/total" markers appended. The main idea is that when editing, one can hit "reflow" to fix the tweet "pagination" without cutting words but preserving line spacing. 

TODO: The app doesn't currently handle posting tweets, only splitting. For now, you can click on any tweet box to copy it to the clipboard. Then past into twitter, one tweet at a time.
