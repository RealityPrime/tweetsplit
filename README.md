# tweetsplit

This is a small MacOs application to split longer text chunks into individual threaded tweets with "tweet#/total" markers appended. The main idea is that when editing, one can hit "reflow" to fix the tweet "pagination" without cutting words but preserving line spacing. 

TODO: The app doesn't currently handle posting tweets, only splitting.
